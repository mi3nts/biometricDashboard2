             The Biometrics Dashboard is a visualization desktop application that allows a user to visualize 
             live data from three different variables: Frequencies from an EEG, SO2 and Oxygen rate in Respiration 
             and the Temperature of a person. This visualization allows a user to draw visual conclusions and catch patterns that might not necessarily be understood othewise. The dashboard is a powerful tool in reaching discovering about the characteristics of Brain Frequencies, SO2, O2 and Temperature.

          <p class="content-light">
            The purpose of this project was the development of an application that takes input from many biometric
            sensors and visualizes such data. This project will aid in the research of how
            particle matter density in the air affects the human body and its functions. Through the use of this application and a
            particulate matter density map/reading, research can be conducted on how human functions
            are impacted by the PM density

          <h2 id="abstract-title">IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
          <p class="content-light">
            The application was divided into into three modules: the EEG module, the repiration module and the temperature module. Within the
            EEG module, the application was to contain an EEG node visualization widget and an EEG graph. Within the respiration module the application
            was to have a heart rate widget and an ECG visualization widget as well as a Photoplethysmogram Graph Visualisation widget and an oxygen saturation\
            widget. The temperature module was built with a thermometer in mind and a body temperature graph for the temperature sub-module along with 
            a widget made for the visualization of Galvanic Skin Response and an accelerometer measuring the acceleration and vibration of the human
            body.

          <p class="content-light">
            The programming language of choice was Python. We also used toolkits such as PyQT5 and libraries like PyqtGraph to built the
            application according to requirements and standards aiming at the success and best implementation of the application

          An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test used to evaluate the electrical activity in the brain. There are 64 electrodes that records frequency from different part of the brain. As an means of categorization for more effective visualization, our EEG module is further divided into three sections based on different bands of frequencies: Delta Band (0-4HZ), Theta Band(4-7HZ) and Alpha Band(8-12HZ). Each of thee electrode presents a color that is associated with the Normalized Scale ranging from -1 to 1, where -1 is the lowest and 1 is highest in scale. Separation of data in this way allows the user to observe the intensity of each range of frequency in that part of the brain and derive conclusions.

              Respiration module is divided into 5 visualizations - SPO2, Heart Rate, PPG, ECG and Respiration Graph. The modules display the concentration of the oxygen in the blood, rate of the heartbeat, blood volume changes, electrical activity of the heart and the breaths/minute respectively. Both HR and SpO2 widgets also display a label depicting the body’s current condition based on the their values.

              The temperature module was split into three different submodules as mentioned in the implementation section: temperature, GSR and an accelerometer. additionally, the team used PyQTgraph and used many of its functions specifically to make some visualization widgets like the accelerometer output the data in a 3-dimensional plane. We concluded that this was the most efficient and clear way to present the values and the results of such decision were nothing but satisfactory.

                      MINTS is a research group based out of the William B. Hanson Center for Space Sciences at The University of Texas at Dallas, and is the sponsor for this project. The main vision for MINTS is facilitating proactive preparedness through preemptive sensing. Providing commanders, environment officers, and individuals actionable insights on multiple spatial and temporal scales for real time data driven decisions. Our sensing scales range from global satellite surveys to local weather stations and mobile units. While these former sensing platforms are geared toward the environment, in this project we focus on a new domain, the human body.
